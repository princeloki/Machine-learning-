# Machine-learning-
Currently learning Machine learning principles like, classification, linear regression and data mining.
These are a few of the projects I've done on my own.
Including a predictor for the infant mortality rate in the country based on race, Web scrapers to mine pokedex information, Restaraunts in San-Fransico from Yelp and even The list of all Attornies in California.
